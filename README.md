# CS2704-Market-Prediction-Algorithm
A project for my CS2704 course. In theory, this will pose as a machine learning model that will extract live stock valuation figures (in this case, live S&amp;P500 valuations) with use of the Alpha Vantage API into a recursive dataset that will self correct in real time via our self learning ML model..
